# Stock-Management-using-Linked-Lists
Reduced system execution time using linked lists.
In projects like Library management, Hospital Management system, we often use file handling in Java, C, C++ to store data. 
The data stored in file is usually in the form of array. Now if we need to insert any data, it will take O(n) time.
Same is the case with deletion and modification of data.

In this project I used data structure (i.e. Linked Lists) to manipulate data. So, now if we need to insert data, it'll take a constant amount of time without any need to shifting of element of the elements that occur after the inserted data.
Hence my execution time decreases.

Challenge for you : I've used Linked list to achieve the purpose. You can use bst and it will even cost you less time to manipulate data. It has some disadvantages though. Think about it!
